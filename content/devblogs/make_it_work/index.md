summary: "Making software project the right way."
---

There are 3 phrases in software project developement.
1. Make it work.
2. Make it right.
3. Make it fast.

Each phrase have their own importance that can not be
skipped or ignored. And following the exact sequence
is important.

## Make it work
- Values
    - From idea to actual prototype.
- Benefits
    - It is easier to discuss potential improvement on
    prototype then abstract ideas.

## Make it right
- Values
    - What does your customer want? Are you solving their
    problem? Are you solving them in the right way?
- Benefits
    - Make sure we are on the right track as early as
    possible so we can reduce the cost of failure.

## Make it fast
- Values
    - Lower cost, faster response, better user experience.

## Common pitfalls
- Focusing on making it right when we did not event
make it work: Spending too much time discussing what's 
right and what's wrong when we didn't even ship the 
first prototype yet. We should ship the first workable
prototype as soon as possible and let the customer
decide what's right and what's wrong.

- Focusing on making it fast when we did not make it 
work or make it right: Focusing on software engineering
or over optimization at the early stage of software 
development is a wast of effort. Software engineering
slow us down. Only when your project is at scale that
it is worth the trade-off. When we are at the 
"make it work" and "make it right" phrase, low cost,
fast developement, frequent iteration is what we 
should be aiming for.
